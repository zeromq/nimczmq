<class name = "zmsg">
    working with multipart messages

    <include filename = "../license.xml" />

    <constructor>
        Create a new empty message object
    </constructor>

    <destructor>
        Destroy a message object and all frames it contains
    </destructor>

    <method name = "recv" singleton = "1">
        Receive message from socket, returns zmsg_t object or NULL if the recv
        was interrupted. Does a blocking recv. If you want to not block then use
        the zloop class or zmsg_recv_nowait or zmq_poll to check for socket input
        before receiving.
        <argument name = "source" type = "anything" />
        <return type = "zmsg" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "send" singleton = "1">
        Send message to destination socket, and destroy the message after sending
        it successfully. If the message has no frames, sends nothing but destroys
        the message anyhow. Nullifies the caller's reference to the message (as
        it is a destructor).
        <argument name = "self_p" type = "zmsg" by_reference = "1" />
        <argument name = "dest" type = "anything" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "sendm" singleton = "1">
        Send message to destination socket as part of a multipart sequence, and
        destroy the message after sending it successfully. Note that after a
        zmsg_sendm, you must call zmsg_send or another method that sends a final
        message part. If the message has no frames, sends nothing but destroys
        the message anyhow. Nullifies the caller's reference to the message (as
        it is a destructor).
        <argument name = "self_p" type = "zmsg" by_reference = "1" />
        <argument name = "dest" type = "anything" />
        <return type = "integer" />

    <method name = "size">
        Return size of message, i.e. number of frames (0 or more).
        <return type = "size" />
    </method>

    <method name = "content size">
        Return total size of all frames in message.
        <return type = "size" />
    </method>

    <method name = "prepend">
        Push frame to the front of the message, i.e. before all other frames.
        Message takes ownership of frame, will destroy it when message is sent.
        Returns 0 on success, -1 on error. Deprecates zmsg_push, which did not
        nullify the caller's frame reference.
        <argument name = "frame_p" type = "zframe" by_reference = "1" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "append">
        Add frame to the end of the message, i.e. after all other frames.
        Message takes ownership of frame, will destroy it when message is sent.
        Returns 0 on success. Deprecates zmsg_add, which did not nullify the
        caller's frame reference.
        <argument name = "frame_p" type = "zframe" by_reference = "1" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "pop">
        Remove first frame from message, if any. Returns frame, or NULL.

        Add block of memory to the end of the message, as a new frame.
        Returns 0 on success, -1 on error.
        <argument name = "src" type = "anything" constant = "1" />
        <argument name = "size" type = "size" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "pushstr">
        Push string as new frame to front of message.

        <argument name = "format" type = "format" />
        <return type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "popstr">
        Pop frame off front of message, return as fresh string. If there were
        no more frames in the message, returns NULL.
        <return type = "string" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "addmsg">
        Push encoded message as a new frame. Message takes ownership of
        submessage, so the original is destroyed in this call. Returns 0 on
        success, -1 on error.
        <argument name = "msg_p" type = "zmsg" by_reference = "1" />
        <return type = "integer" />

        decoding was not succesfull.
        <return type = "zmsg" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "remove">
        Remove specified frame from list, if present. Does not destroy frame.
        <argument name = "frame" type = "zframe" />
    </method>

    <method name = "first">
        Set cursor to first frame in message. Returns frame, or NULL, if the 
        message is empty. Use this to navigate the frames as a list.
        <return type = "zframe" />
    </method>

    <method name = "next">
        Return the next frame. If there are no more frames, returns NULL. To move
        to the first frame call zmsg_first(). Advances the cursor.
        <return type = "zframe" />
    </method>

    <method name = "last">
        Return the last frame. If there are no frames, returns NULL.
        <return type = "zframe" />
    </method>

    <method name = "save">
        Save message to an open file, return 0 if OK, else -1. The message is 
        saved as a series of frames, each with length and data. Note that the
        file is NOT guaranteed to be portable between operating systems, not
        versions of CZMQ. The file format is at present undocumented and liable
        to arbitrary change.
        <argument name = "file" type = "FILE" />

        <return type = "zmsg" fresh = "1" />

    <method name = "encode">
        Serialize multipart message to a single buffer. Use this method to send
        structured messages across transports that do not support multipart data.
        Allocates and returns a new buffer containing the serialized message.
        To decode a serialized message buffer, use zmsg_decode ().
        <argument name = "buffer" type = "buffer" by_reference = "1" fresh = "1" />
        <return type = "size" />
    </method>

    <method name = "decode" singleton = "1">
        Decodes a serialized message buffer created by zmsg_encode () and returns
        a new zmsg_t object. Returns NULL if the buffer was badly formatted or 
        there was insufficient memory to work.
        <argument name = "buffer" type = "buffer" />
        <argument name = "buffer size" type = "size" />
        <return type = "zmsg" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "dup">
        Create copy of message, as new message object. Returns a fresh zmsg_t

        configured by zsys_set_logstream).
    </method>

    <method name = "eq">
        Return true if the two messages have the same number of frames and each
        frame in the first message is identical to the corresponding frame in the
        other message. As with zframe_eq, return false if either message is NULL.
        <argument name = "other" type = "zmsg" />
        <return type = "boolean" />
    </method>

    <method name = "new signal" singleton = "1">
        Generate a signal message encoding the given status. A signal is a short
        message carrying a 1-byte success/failure code (by convention, 0 means
        OK). Signals are encoded to be distinguishable from "normal" messages.
        <argument name = "status" type = "byte" />
        <return type = "zmsg" fresh = "1" />
    </method>

    <method name = "signal">
        Return signal value, 0 or greater, if message is a signal, -1 if not.
        <return type = "integer" />

        <return type = "boolean" />
    </method>

    <method name = "test" singleton = "1">
        Self test of this class
        <argument name = "verbose" type = "boolean" />
    </method>
</class>
